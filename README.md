# Brandboard React Frontend

This is the React frontend of a Branding/Moodboard generator app, intended for use with the Flask backend available here: [brandboard-flask](https://github.com/AbigailMathews/brandboard-flask)

This React app was bootstrapped with [React Material Kit](https://appseed.us/apps/material-kit)

The UI elements were designed by [CreativeTim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-react)

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.x
